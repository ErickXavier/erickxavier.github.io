# material-developer-website
This is a template under Creative Commons, for developers/designers/etc who doesn't have much time to create their own website and/or portfolio online.

My own example: http://erick.pro/

It uses http://materializecss.com/ , http://angularjs.com/ and http://jquery.com/ as main environment and frameworks.

First version was made by http://www.erpik.com/ and with his permission, I integrated it with AngularJS and a buch of JSON files.

So, feel free to fork and use for your own website ;)
