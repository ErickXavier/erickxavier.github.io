# material-developer-website
This is a template under Creative Commons, for developers/designers/etc who doesn't have much time to create their own website and/or portfolio online.

My own example: http://erick.pro/

It uses http://materializecss.com/ , http://angularjs.com/ and http://jquery.com/ as main environment and frameworks.

First version was made by http://www.erpik.com/ and with his permission, I integrated it with AngularJS and a buch of JSON files.

TO-DOs:
- contact.php to send the email of the contact form
- integration with common RSS/XML to fill the BLOG area
- finalize the Lab area
- hide the 'top button' when not necessary

So, feel free to fork and use for your own website ;)
